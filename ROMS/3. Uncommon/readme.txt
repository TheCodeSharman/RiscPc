ROM300 - Acorn
--------------

The first, buggy version of RISC OS 3. It only supported
the new A5000 hardware, and was quickly replaced by RISC OS 3.10

ROM319 - Acorn - Jun 1993
-------------------------

RISC OS 3.11 translated into German

ROM380.ARM6ARM7 - Acorn - Apr 1998
----------------------------------

Whilst developing the RiscPC 2, Acorn used existing hardware
to develope the OS. New features include an improved filer (supporting
> 77 objects per directory and long filenames), lazy task swapping
(speed boost on some StrongARM variants), a new extensible configure
system, and a much updated visual style. 

This was released to registered developers as a softload over
a previous RISC OS version. It did not support the StrongARM
processor, only ARM610/ARM710/ARM7500(FE) to encourage registered
developers to upgrade to the RiscPC2 when it came out, rather than
stick with the RPC1 and 3.80).

ROM380.SA - Acorn - Apr 1998
----------------------------

This more exclusive build of RISC OS 3.80 also supports
the StrongARM processor.
